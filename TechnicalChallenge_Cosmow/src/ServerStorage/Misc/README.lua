Just made a quick little demo for the technical challenge. In it I make use of Knit, ProfileService, ReplicaService, 
and some of my own modules from other projects
The only things I did NOT personally code (although some of it was modified) are;
 Knit (and it's packages), ProfileService, ReplicaService, ReplicaControllerInterface, PlayerDataController, PlayerDataService, 
 and Madwork packages

There are some areas in the codebase that I would improve but for the sake of time and this being just a demo, 
I used more convenient or pseudo methods
I omitted the use of Component and Trove in some cases where it COULD be used but certainly did not need to be used for just a demo

In total it took me about 6 hours, I had to warm up to Knit again so that did hinder my speed. 
Officially finished by Joey (lysandr) as of 1/26/2024 at 4:52 PM

The goal of the game is to make passive money, kill enemy troops, buy troops, upgrade your troops, 
upgrade your own stats; HP, dmg, speed, get better weapons, etc.

I used a zombie free model which I had to retrofit to work with this demo, and then some free model trees
